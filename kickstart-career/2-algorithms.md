# Technique {-}



1. See the Data - *algo question = numbers and data* - The words and "theme" is
a trap, only see data and numbers

2. Multiple Passes - *simplify & modify into more familiar problems*

3. Problem & Data Type Toolbox - *train by practice / memorize*



# ADT Toolbox {-}

hash-map

:    *dictionary* - O(1) to look up data based on key, O(1) to set data
based on key. **Your fave ADT for faster, simpler algos!**

list

:    *array*, *sequence* - O(n) to linear search, O(1) to look up index - good
for ordered data

stack

:    *Last in First Out* - O(1) to add or remove - good for reversing things,
recursive things

queue

:    *First in First Out* - O(1) to add or remove - good for processing things
in order

tree

:    *root* node connected to children and descendants

graph

:    *vertices* connected with *edges*


# Sorting Algos {-}

quicksort

:    *time avg O(n log n) - space O(log n)* - pick a pivot, sort w.r.t. to
pivot into two partitions, sort each partition using quicksort (another pivot)

mergesort

:    *time avg O(n log n) - space O(n)* - split, sort each array using
mergesort (smaller arrays), combine sorted arrays in order


insertion sort

:    *time avg O(n^2^) - space O(1)* - "pick up" an item, and move left into
sorted portion until you find a spot where it fits between, then place

selection sort

:    *time avg O(n^2^) - space O(1)* - find smallest item, put on left in sorted
portion, then repeat for next smallest in unsorted


bubblesort

:    *time avg O(n^2^)  - space O(1)* - keep on swapping adjacent items, until
you go through the array with no more items needing to be swapped


# Problem Toolbox  {-}


minimum

:    *O(n)*

```python
min_found = None
for n in list_of_numbers:
    if min_found == None:
        min_found = n
    if n < min_found:
        min_found = n
```


maximum

:    *O(n)* - implementation is same as above, save for `n > max_found`{.python}


counting occurrences

:    *O(n)*

```python
c = {}
for item in items:
    if item not in c:
        c[item] = 0
    c[item] += 1
```


filtering collection

:    *O(n)* - create a new, smaller list only containing data adhering to a
condition

```python
output = []
for item in items:
    if item > 5: # or something
        output.append(item)
```



transforming collection

:    *O(n)* - create a list of same length, but with data changed

```python
output = []
for item in items:
    # Any method or operation
    modified = item * 2
    output.append(modified)
```


intersection between collections

:    *O(n)* - find items in one collection that are (or are not) in another
collection. Use `set` instead of `list` since set operations are O(1)

```python
data_2_set = set(data_2)
overlap = []
for item in data_1:
    if item in data_2_set:
        overlap.append(item)
```


cross operation

:    *O(n^2^)* - perform operation on each element w.r.t. another element

```python
out = []
for a in data_1:
    for b in data_2:
        out.append(a * b)
```

# Data structures {-}

Many approaches to implement ADTs:


Linked lists

: Implement with dicts

```python
c = {"data": "C", "next": None}
b = {"data": "B", "next": c}
a = {"data": "A", "next": b}
```

Stacks, queues

: Just a list, but only using first and/or last items

Tree

: Impl. with dicts and lists

```python
root = {
  "data": "Grandma",
  "children": [{
      "data": "Mom",
      "children": [{"data": "Me"}],
    }, {
      "data": "uncle",
      "children": []
  }]
}
```


Graph (directed)

: Store vertices in dict, outward edges in list

```python
graph = {
  "NYC": ["SFO", "ORD", "DTW", "LAX"],
  "SFO": ["LAX", "OAK", "NYC", "DTW"],
  "SAC": ["OAK", "SFO", "LAX"],
}
```




# Terminology {-}

Polya's 4 Steps

:     \
    **1** Understand the problem - **2** Devise a plan - **3** Carry it out -
    **4** Verify & review

<!--
Problem

:    Given an input of a certain type, make an output (solution)
-->

Algorithm

:    A precise series of steps that solves a problem


Implementation

:    The code used to perform an algorithm


Time complexity

:    *speed* - "Given a problem input of size *n*, how many steps
does algo take to solve?"

Big O

:    Notation for time complexity


Abstract Data Types

:    Ways to structure data, defined in English, useful to model data


Data structures

:    Implementations with code of an ADT, used to implement algorithms
