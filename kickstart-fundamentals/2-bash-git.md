# Bash {-}

Navigating
:   \ 

    ```bash
    cd name_of_directory
    cd ..     # Go up one
    cd ~      # Go to home
    pwd       # Where am I?
    ```

Listing files
:   \ 

    ```bash
    ls        # List files
    ls -a     # See hidden
    ls -l     # See more info
    ls -R     # Recursive
    ```

Moving and renaming
:   \ 

    ```bash
    mv file.txt new_name.txt
    mv file.txt ../new/place/
    ```

Copying
:   \ 

    ```bash
    cp file.txt file_backup.txt
    cp -r directory/ backup/
    ```

Deleting
:   \ 

    ```bash
    rm file.txt
    rmdir empty_directory/
    rm -r full_directory/
    ```

Creating
:   \ 

    ```bash
    mkdir my_directory
    touch empty_file.py
    ```

Reading data from file
:   \ 

    ```bash
    cat filename.txt
    cat file1 file2 file3
    ```

Redirecting data into file
:   \ 

    ```bash
    ls -R > all_files.txt
    cat a.html b.html > c.html
    ```

Running file as bash script
:   \ 

    ```bash
    # Save commands to script.sh
    bash script.sh
    ```

# Bash tricks {-}

Auto complete

:   Start typing then hit `<Tab>`. Hit twice for
options.

Previous command history

:   `<Up>`

Search previous history

:   `<Ctrl+R>` then start typing, `<Ctrl+R>` to cycle
back, `<Enter>` to run.



Wildcards
:   \ 

    ```bash
    rm *.jpg # Delete jpg files
    ```

Advanced piping
:   \ 

    ```bash
    # Search process for "chrome"
    ps -e | grep chrome
    find . | grep .py$ # find py files
    ```

# Git {-}

Starting GitHub repo
:   Click button on GitHub.  Check box to create with "README".  Then clone
locally (`U` and `R` should be username and repo name):

```bash
git clone http://github.com/U/R.git
```


Starting (local-only) repo
:  \ 

    ```bash
    git init
    ```



Adding changes and committing
:   \ 

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Fixed :)"
    ```

Finding out status
:   \ 

    ```bash
    git status
    git log
    ```

Learning about past
:   \ 

    ```bash
    git log         # Q to quit
    git show f85bfcf
    git diff f85bfcf master
    git checkout f85bfcf 
    ```

Branch workflow
:   \ 

    ```bash
    git branch my-stuff
    git checkout my-stuff
    # Do some work...
    git add -A
    git commit -m "did stuff"
    git checkout master
    git merge my-stuff
    ```

Interacting with GitHub
:   \ 

    ```bash
    git pull # get updates
    # Do some work...
    git add -A
    git commit -m "it works!"
    git push # share updates
    ```

# Key Terms {-}

Repository

:     A repo is a "git enabled" directory, stores "undo-history" (commit log)
and enables collaboration (via *push* and *pull*).

Commit

:   The state of a *repo*, as if frozen-in-time, uniquely designated by a
*hash* (long series of letters and numbers).

# Python {-}

You can test Python with the interactive prompt (aka "REPL"):

Interactive prompt
:   \ 

    ```python
    python3
    >>> print("Hello world")
    Hello world
    >>> 5 + 5
    10
    >>> exit()
    ```

Running code from file
:   \ 

    ```bash
    # Save code as mycode.py
    python3 mycode.py
    ```

Hello world program
:   \ 

    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    menu = "Spam spam spam"
    print(menu)
    ```

# Python I/O {-}

Reading text from file
:   \ 

    ```python
    text = open("file.txt").read()
    print("file.txt has: ", text)
    ```

Writing to file
:   \ 

    ```python
    text = "Some text for o.txt"
    open("o.txt", "w+").write(text)
    ```

Appending to file
:   \ 

    ```python
    text = "Repeat this text x3"
    open("o.txt", "a+").write(text)
    open("o.txt", "a+").write(text)
    open("o.txt", "a+").write(text)
    ```

Combining files
:   \ 

    ```python
    start = open("f1.txt").read()
    end = open("f2.txt").read()
    full = start + end
    open("f3.txt", "w+").write(full)
    ```

# Key Terms {-}

Variable

:   A named "bucket" that holds data. Can be updated with *assignment operator*
(equals sign `=`)

String

:   Text data, term comes from "string of characters"

Operator

:   A symbol that can perform arithmetic, modifying and
combines data in variables, e.g. `+/-`.
